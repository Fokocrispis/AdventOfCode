# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I share my solutions to the daily programming puzzles provided by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). These challenges are a fun way to explore algorithms, improve coding skills, and get into the festive spirit! 🎅

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Java ☕
- **IDE**: Eclipse 

---

Each day contains:
- `DayX_values.txt`: The puzzle input provided by Advent of Code.
- `Test`: My main class implementation of the solution.
- `Reader`: My class used to extract the .txt file and save the information in a desired data structure.
- `Processor`: My class to trigger other classes and effectuate processes
- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the approach used to solve the day's challenge.
